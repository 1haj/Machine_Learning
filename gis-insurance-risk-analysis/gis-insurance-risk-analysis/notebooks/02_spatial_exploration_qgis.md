# Spatial Exploration using QGIS

## Steps:
1. Load `claims_processed.csv` into QGIS as a point layer.
2. Set CRS to EPSG:4326.
3. Visualize claim density using heatmaps.
4. Identify high-risk clusters based on claim frequency.
5. Overlay regions layer to compare spatial risk distribution.

## Insights:
- Central London shows higher claim density.
- Vehicle claims dominate high-density zones.
- Supports geographic risk-based pricing strategies.
